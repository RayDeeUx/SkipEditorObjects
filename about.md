# SkipEditorObjects

*Special thanks to [iAndyHD3](user:1688850) for making this proof-of-concept mod possible.*

<cy>*Note that object IDs 914 (custom text) and 1615 (item ID counter) may not supported (depending on what the changelog says) due to technical limitations between game versions.*</c>

Ever wanted to de-clutter your object choices in the level editor? Have at it!

Specify the objects you'd like to skip by coing to the config directory of this mod (after installing this mod and viewing its settings). You'll see a text file with further instructions (aptly named `custom.txt`) that you can edit.

For an easier reference on object IDs, please copy the level "[Object IDs New](level:99784974)" by [Colon](user:106255). (If one link doesn't work, try the other.)

Note that this mod does *not* stop you from placing object IDs specified in your `custom.txt` file, it only hides the button in the Editor UI.

For JSON-literate folks, or for people who would like to hide objects based on historical Geometry Dash game versions, please use iAndyHD3's `Hide Editor Objects` mod whenever it is available on the index.
