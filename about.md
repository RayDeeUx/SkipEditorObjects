# SkipEditorObjects

<cy>*Note that object IDs 914 (custom text) and 1615 (item ID counter) may not be supported (depending on what the changelog says) due to technical limitations between game versions.*</c>

Ever wanted to de-clutter your object choices in the level editor? Have at it!

Specify the objects you'd like to skip by coing to the config directory of this mod (after installing this mod and viewing its settings). You'll see a text file with further instructions (aptly named `custom.txt`) that you can edit.

For an easier reference on object IDs, please copy the level "[Object IDs New](level:99784974)" by [Colon](user:106255). (If one link doesn't work, try the other.)

Preset files to hide objects that were unavailable during each historical Geometry Dash version are also available in the mod's resources directory. Check the mod's settings for a shortcut to that directory.\
<cy>There are no guarantees that these preset files are 100% accurate for each game version.</c>

Note that this mod does *not* stop you from placing object IDs specified in your `custom.txt` file, it only hides the button in the Editor UI.

For JSON-literate folks, also check out RaZoom's `Object Groups` mod.
