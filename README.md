# SkipEditorObjects

*Special thanks to [iAndyHD3](https://github.com/iAndyHD3) for making this proof-of-concept mod possible.*

<cy>*Note that object IDs 914 (custom text) and 1615 (item ID counter) are not supported as of v1.1.0 due to technical limitations.*</c>

Ever wanted to de-clutter your object choices in the level editor? Have at it!

Install the mod on the Geode index for further instructions.

For an easier reference on object IDs, please refer to [Colon](https://gdbrowser.com/u/106255)'s "[Object IDs New](https://gdbrowser.com/99784974)" level.

Note that this mod does *not* stop you from placing object IDs specified in your `custom.txt` file, it only hides the button in the Editor UI.

For JSON-literate folks, or for people who would like to hide objects based on historical Geometry Dash game versions, please check out iAndyHD3's `Hide Editor Objects` mod whenever it is available on GitHub.
