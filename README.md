# SkipEditorObjects

*Special thanks to ~~[OBFUSCATED]~~ for making this proof-of-concept mod possible.*

<cy>*Note that object IDs 914 (custom text) and 1615 (item ID counter) may not be supported (depending on what the changelog says) due to technical limitations between game versions.*</c>

Ever wanted to de-clutter your object choices in the level editor? Have at it!

Install the mod on the Geode index for further instructions.

For an easier reference on object IDs, please refer to [Colon](https://gdbrowser.com/u/106255)'s "[Object IDs New](https://gdbrowser.com/99784974)" level.

Note that this mod does *not* stop you from placing object IDs specified in your `custom.txt` file, it only hides the button in the Editor UI.

For JSON-literate folks, also check out RaZoom's `Object Groups` mod.
